fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    println!("x: {x}");
    // x = 20;
    // println!("x: {x}");
}











// Uncomment the x = 20 to demonstrate that variables are immutable by default. Add the mut keyword to allow changes.

// The i32 here is the type of the variable. This must be known at compile time, but type inference (covered later) allows the programmer to omit it in many cases.
